# Arvish

Lib that helps you create [Arvis](https://github.com/jopemachine/arvis) `workflow`, `plugin` more easily.

(Not necessary for extension creation).

## Composition

Arvish has both the Cli tools and js libraries needed to create `extension`

Check each of the below documents.

* [Cli](./documents/cli.md)

* [Library](./documents/lib.md)

## alfy

This library is forked from [alfy](https://github.com/sindresorhus/alfy).

So, It has almost same programmatic API with `alfy`.

This means maybe you can simply replace alfred-workflows written in `alfy` with `arvish`.

Note that `arvish` not support below features yet.

* `top-await`
* `alfred-notifier`
* `alfred-link`
* `alfred-update`
